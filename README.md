# Auriga Backplane

The project is reverse-engineered from the original backplane to house dual 2.5" SSDs into one 3.5" HDD bay with
[this mounting bracket](https://www.corsair.com/us/en/p/pc-components-accessories/cssd-brkt2/dual-ssd-mounting-bracket-aca-a-black-cssd-brkt2).
All mechanical dimensions are hand-measured and "rounded to a reasonable factor in metric units."

# Known Issues

The pin layout of the LED connectors are reversed (as of v0.5.) Therefore one side of the ribbon cable must be
reversed in order to activate the LED indicators.
